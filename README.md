## Installation

To install Stack, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @yuiii1234/stack
```

or

```bash
yarn add @yuiii1234/stack
```

Once installed, you can import Stack into your components.

---

## Usage

Using Stack is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it in your project.

### Basic Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Stack } from '@yuiii1234/stack';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Stack direction="column" spacing={10}>
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightblue', height: '100px' }}>Item 1</div>
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightgreen', height: '100px' }}>Item 2</div>
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightcoral', height: '100px' }}>Item 3</div>
    </Stack>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Stack` component arranges three items in a vertical column with a spacing of 10 pixels between them.

### Props

- **direction**: Defines the direction of the stack. Accepts values `row` or `column`.
- **spacing**: Sets the space between items in pixels.
- **align**: Aligns items within the stack. Accepts values `flex-start`, `center`, or `flex-end`.
- **justify**: Justifies items along the main axis. Accepts values `flex-start`, `center`, `flex-end`, or `space-between`.

## Examples

### Responsive Layout

To create a responsive layout, you can adjust the `direction` and `spacing` props based on screen size.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Stack } from '@yuiii1234/stack';

const ResponsiveApp = () => {
  const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768;

  return (
    <Stack direction={isMobile ? "column" : "row"} spacing={isMobile ? 5 : 20}>
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightblue', height: '100px' }}>Item 1</div>
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightgreen', height: '100px' }}>Item 2</div>
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightcoral', height: '100px' }}>Item 3</div>
    </Stack>
  );
};

export default ResponsiveApp;
```

### Nested Stacks

You can also nest Stack components for more complex layouts.

```javascript
<Stack direction="row" spacing={10}>
  <Stack direction="column" spacing={5}>
    <div>Item 1.1</div>
    <div>Item 1.2</div>
  </Stack>
  <Stack direction="column" spacing={5}>
    <div>Item 2.1</div>
    <div>Item 2.2</div>
  </Stack>
</Stack>
```
